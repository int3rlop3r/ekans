# ekans

A terminal version of the popular snake game that doesn't use curses. The speed increases automatically as you grow and eat more `$`s. Oh and watch out for the borders!

## Try it out!

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/int3rlop3r/ekans/releases/latest/download/ekans
    $ chmod +x ekans
    $ ./ekans

Or just run `go install github.com/int3rlop3r/ekans@latest` to install the latest version.

## Note

As of now only linux binaries are available on the 'releases' page. If you want to try it out on a mac you'll need to run the `go install` command mentioned above (assuming you have already installed go).
